          <h3><strong>Principal Investigator</strong></h3>
          <p><strong>Ulf D. Schiller</strong> (Dr. rer.-nat., Dipl.-Phys., Dipl.-Inform.)
          </br>Assistant Professor, Materials Science and Engineering
        </br>Faculty Scholar, Clemson University School of Health Research

        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>Dr. Ulf Schiller joined the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Clemson University in 2016.
            He studied Computer Science and Physics at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, and obtained his doctoral degree
            from the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research working on lattice
            Boltzmann simulations of complex fluids and soft matter. Following his doctoral degree, Schiller was awarded a Fellowship
            in Computational Sciences from Volkswagen Stiftung. After postdoctoral stays at the University of Florida and Forschungszentrum
            JÃ¼lich, Germany, he joined the Centre for Computational Science at University College London, UK, where he maintains a visiting
            affiliation. Dr. Schiller's research interests cover a range of topics in computational soft matter and bio-inspired materials.
            He is particularly interested in elucidating, by means of computer simulations, how complex multiscale phenomena give rise to
            macroscopic materials properties. Dr. Schiller has extensive experience in developing novel scale-briding algorithms and state-of-the-art
            simulation techniques. He contributed the first parallel lattice Boltzmann implementation to the ESPResSo software package and is a regular
            lecturer at the CECAM sponsored ESPResSo summer schools. At Clemson, the Schiller Research Group leverages the high performance computing
            capabilities of the Palmetto cluster to aid the discovery and design of new materials through computational science.</p>
